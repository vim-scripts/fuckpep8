This plugin is intended to make life feasible for those of us who are right in the head, and use the proper tools (tabs) for indentation. It uses the awesome detectindent plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script\_id=1171) to detect how many spaces the poor misguided souls that originally wrote a given Python file use, replace them with tabs, and switch it back before saving.
